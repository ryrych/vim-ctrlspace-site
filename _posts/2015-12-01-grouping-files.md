Grouping files is a secret weapon of *vim-ctrlspace* that allows you to work in
a way that **vanilla Vim doesn’t**. I’ll spare you tricky details about *Vim*
buffers, tabs, and the like. Just **treat grouped files in tabs** as
a workspaces arrangement, OK? See example:

*Docs & Notes* tab groups all project notes and documentation.  Implementing
authentication you can group all related files under *Google OAuth 2.0* tab.
You can even keep files from any projects or directory as you’re not limited by
the project scope. This way a third tab, *Plans & goals* can be added. 

Will **learning vim-ctrlspace** land in your **2016 Plan & goals** list?
