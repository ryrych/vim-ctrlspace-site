Once you [added your first project to bookmarks][1], every time you start
working on the project, after opening *Vim*, you have to select the project in
*Vim-CtrlSpace*. Fortunately all you have to do is **pressing**:

<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SPACE</kbd> and then <kbd>b</kbd>.

## Opening projects in search mode

Capital <kbd>B</kbd> **opens the project list in the search mode** so you can
find the project faster.

Alternatively you can open the list of projects with <kbd>b</kbd> and then
open the search mode with <kbd>/</kbd>. The same applies for all lists.

Opening projects in *Vim* has never been so easy!
